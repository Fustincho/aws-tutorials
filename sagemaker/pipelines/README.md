# Sagemaker Pipelines

## Introduction

This repository offers a comprehensive guide on AWS Sagemaker Pipelines, structured to facilitate both novice and experienced users in understanding and implementing Sagemaker Pipelines. The approach is incremental, beginning with fundamental concepts and progressively moving towards more complex pipeline applications.

## Objective

The goal of this tutorial is to provide practical examples and clear explanations for creating and managing machine learning pipelines using AWS Sagemaker. Upon completion, learners will have gained a thorough understanding of Sagemaker Pipelines, equipping them with the skills to implement these in various machine learning projects.

## Structure

The content is organized into a series of Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a specific aspect of Sagemaker Pipelines. The material is segmented into units, with each subsequent unit expanding upon the knowledge and skills presented in the preceding ones.

### Units Overview

1. [Your first Sagemaker Endpoint](unit_1.ipynb): This unit introduces the foundational steps to create and deploy a machine learning model using AWS Sagemaker. The primary focus is on setting up a basic Sagemaker endpoint, which serves as a critical component for model hosting and real-time predictions.
