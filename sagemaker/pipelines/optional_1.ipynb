    "In this brief and optional module, we will take a look to SageMaker Warm Pools. They allow you to retain and reuse provisioned infrastructure after completing a training job. This reduces latency for repetitive tasks, such as iterative experimentation or consecutive jobs, by avoiding the time-consuming process of resource provisioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will utilize the same training job structure and dataset from [unit 1](./unit_1.ipynb) to demonstrate the use of SageMaker Warm Pools. The primary difference is the addition of a new variable to the `Estimator`, which is responsible for activating the warm pool."
