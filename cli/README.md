# AWS Scripting Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of scripts to explore, learn, and implement different aspects of AWS. The goal is to create efficient automation tools that help streamline cloud workflows. Each script targets a specific AWS feature or combination of services, offering practical use cases with concise code examples.

## Project Philosophy

1. **Learning-Oriented**: These scripts are designed for understanding and experimenting with AWS services, ideal for anyone looking to expand their cloud computing skills.
  
2. **Reusable Components**: The scripts are modular and contain clear instructions so that you can customize and extend them for your unique workflows.
  
3. **Practical Solutions**: Each script addresses real-world tasks like automating deployments or managing cloud resources, providing solutions you can readily apply to your projects.

4. **AWS CLI Interaction**: This project emphasizes learning to interact with AWS using the CLI (Command Line Interface), providing a deep understanding of the underlying commands and configurations.

## List of Scripts

1. **[ECR to Lambda Update (ecr_lambda_update.sh):](./ecr_lambda_update/README.md)**
